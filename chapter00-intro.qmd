## Background of the Study

### Bank Regulation and Supervision in the Post-Global Financial Crisis(GFC) Era

The repercussions of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007-2009 led to a redesign of the global financial regulatory architecture. The GFC has caused extensive disruptions in financial markets and abrupt and persistent impacts on economic growth, requiring a comprehensive and globally coordinated response from the public sector. The regulatory reform agenda the Group of Twenty (G20) leaders agreed in 2009 elevated the overhaul of the Basel regulatory and supervisory framework. The Basel III framework enhances capital buffers, improves the quality of bank capital, reduces leverage, and incorporates macroprudential policy design, such as the liquidity risk elements, aiming at strengthening the resilience of the global banking system. Implementation of the Basel III capital regulation has largely advanced as planned. As one of the member jurisdictions of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), China embraced and fully adopted the Basel III framework in 2012. According to the latest Regulatory Consistency Assessment Program (RCAP) report by BCBS, China was found largely compliant with the standards for imposing more intense supervision and surcharges for capital [@BCBS2014]. 


### China's Banking Landscape

China's banking sector is a vital component of the national financial system, and its effective functioning is crucial to the country's economic health and development [@BERGER2009]. China's banking sector has evolved and made notable progress through financial reform over the last forty years, although it developed much later than developed economies [@LEE2013]. 

Since 1978, China has been implementing comprehensive financial reform, closely intertwined with its broader economic restructuring efforts. This reform initiative extends across various dimensions of the Chinese banking sector, encompassing institutions, regulations, and market dynamics. Over the years, it has been a pivotal component of the country's economic transformation, aiming to modernize and enhance the efficiency and stability of its financial system. The literature commonly identifies three main stages/waves of the financial reform in the times before 2010: since 1978 to the early 1990s; during the 1990s until 2001 China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO); and since the entry of the WTO, through five years of transitional time until 2010 [see @BERGER2009; @WANG2014; @DONG2017].

Between 1979 and 1992, China's banking sector underwent a comprehensive institutional restructuring, including the creation of the "Big Four" [^chapter00-intro-01] State-Owned Commercial Banks (1979-1984), establishment of national banks and diversification of ownership (1986-1987), diversification of financial institution types (1980s), and transition of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to a central bank (1984). This initial wave served as a significant milestone in China's reform process as new players entered financial markets. During this time, the government exhibited a conservative stance regarding the entry of foreign banks and ownership diversification. 

During the second stage (1990s-2001) there was a decline in the loan quality of major state-owned banks and the establishment of assets management companies to address the issues. Ownership structures of national banks transitioned to joint-stock models, with private ownership notably emerging in China. The commercialization of banks is a distinctive feature of this period. 

From 2001 to 2010, China underwent comprehensive economic reforms following its entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO). Alongside the transformation of commercial banks, legislative efforts, and the opening of domestic financial markets to foreign banks, marketization emerged as a distinctive feature of this stage. Public offerings enrich shareholder profiles and promote modern corporate governance frameworks in banks. 

Since 2010, rather than pursuing a structural overhaul, China's financial sector has witnessed nuanced improvements and refinements. The ownership landscape has diversified, embracing models such as state-owned, joint-stock with local government participation, and joint-stock with private company shareholders in financial institutions. 

Over four decades, the financial reform in China's banking sector transformed the landscape, fostering marketization, securitization, and globalization. The outcomes of the financial reform include the emergence of diversified ownership structures, modern corporate governance practices, and intensified market competition. The reforms indicate a gradual receding of direct government intervention in banking decisions. Seizing the opportunity presented by the GFC, China's financial reform is propelled towards establishing a sound and competitive banking sector dedicated to supporting the real economy.

## Research Motivation and Research Questions

The GFC uncovered weaknesses in the design and implementation of the pre-crisis regulatory framework that it failed to "contain the 
the buildup of vulnerabilities and tame the incentives of market participants to take excessive risks" [@IMF2018]. Shortly after the GFC began, regulatory consensus was reached by the G20 that it was necessary for financial institutions to be subject to more robust and effective regulations and supervision. More stringent capital adequacy requirements, including enhanced capital buffers and reduced leverage, are one of the overhauls addressed to the prevailing Basel framework.^[See the information of the Basel Accords in the appendix in Chapter 2.]  Another crucial regulatory development in the post-crisis era has been a greater emphasis on systemic stability and macroprudential regulatory framework. While regulatory consensus has been made on more stringent capital regulation, there is continued contentious debate regarding the role of Basel III capital adequacy requirements. Proponents of more stringent capital requirements state that increased capital requirements provide social value and facilitate banks to make "more economically appropriate" decisions [@ADMATI2014]. On the other hand, opponents of higher capital requirements argue that these would hinder economic growth [@DE-ANGELO2013]. 

As presented in the previous section, the Chinese banking sector has experienced several rounds of financial reform over the past few decades. China's financial authorities have fully adopted and localized the Basel III framework into China's legislation since 2013. The landscape of China's banking sector has been dramatically transformed. Chinese banks actively participate in global financial markets and contribute to the interconnectedness of the international financial system. These notable achievements have not only laid a solid foundation for the future development of China's financial system, but also made the Chinese banking sector a unique context to investigate the role of the Basel III capital regulation. Firstly, China's banking industry operates within a dynamic and rapidly evolving economic environment characterized by significant growth, diverse financial institutions, and varying levels of market development across regions. Secondly, the Chinese banking sector features a mix of state-owned banks, joint-stock banks, and foreign banks, each with its own set of challenges and priorities. Thirdly, China's integration into the global financial system is ongoing, with increasing cross-border transactions and exposures. The implementation and impact of Basel III capital regulation in China offer valuable insights into how such regulations function in diverse and evolving financial landscapes.

A body of literature examines the relationship between capital, risk, and efficiency of Chinese commercial banks. @TAN2013 examine the relationship between capital, risk and bank efficiency following the hypotheses proposed by @BERGER1997. They report a negative relationship between capitalization and bank risk. @LEE2015 find that capital has a negative impact on bank profitability, supporting the "risk-return hypothesis" [see @ALTUNBAS2007], and a negative relationship between capital and risk in favor of the "moral hazard hypothesis" [see @DEMIRGUC-KUNT2002]. @PESSAROSSI2015 suggest that capital adequacy requirements have a positive impact on cost efficiency of Chinese banks. These studies focus on the period before 2011. 

Regarding the ownership structure and its impact on bank risk-taking and performance, research interest remains focused on state ownership. Two alternative theories regarding state ownership in banks have been proposed in the literature: the social view and the political view. The social view, rooted in the economic theory of institutions, posits that state ownership serves as a form of government intervention aimed at addressing market failures, improving market functions, and enhancing economic performance [@STIGLITZ1993]. On the other hand, the political view contends that state ownership primarily generates political benefits for politicians rather than promoting social welfare [see @SHLEIFER1994; @SHLEIFER1997]. The empirical studies provide mixed results in favor of both views [see @ANDRIANOVA2012; @LA-PORTA2002; @BECK2002]. Most of the aforementioned studies on Chinese banks consider bank size instead of bank ownership. @BERGER2009 investigate the efficiency of Chinese banks over 1994-2003 and find the Big Four banks are the least efficient and the foreign-owned banks are the most efficient in China's banking industry. 

Following the GFC of 2007-2009, there has been a shift in research focus towards investigating systemic risk and the macroprudential regulation of financial systems. However, there is a scarcity of literature examining the connection between capital regulation and systemic risk in the Chinese banking industry. Several studies explore various aspects of systemic risk in the Chinese banking industry. @GANG2015 observe an increase in systemic risk due to monetary policy shocks. @HUANG2019 utilize multiple measures to assess systemic risk in Chinese banks. @ZHANG2021 concentrate on the relationship between liquidity creation and systemic risk, identifying a "U shape" pattern in the Chinese banking sector. 

Therefore, the lack of consistent results after the GFC and the unique context of the Chinese banking sector provides strong motivation to examine the role of Basel III capital regulation and its impact on individual banks' credit risk-taking, efficiency, and systemic risk contribution. 

This study aims to examine the interplay among the comprehensive implementation of Basel III capital regulation, the credit risk-taking behavior of individual banks, cost efficiency, and their contribution to systemic risk. This investigation takes into consideration the diverse ownership structure, predominantly characterized by state ownership, within China's banking industry.

Utilizing the latest panel data of Chinese banks spanning from 2010 to the present, this study contributes to the investigation of three research questions. The first research question explores the impact of Basel III capital regulation on bank credit risk-taking, considering the interplay between capital regulation and ownership structure. The second research question, employing a sophisticated four-component stochastic frontier approach (SFA), examines whether stringent capital regulation affects persistent or transitional Chinese bank efficiency. The third research question evaluates the dynamics of systemic risk in the Chinese banking sector, assessing the influence of Basel III and ownership structures.



## Overview of Chapters

### Chapter 2. The Review of China's Banking Industry Landscape

Chapter 2 offers a comprehensive examination of China's banking landscape, beginning by reviewing the evolutionary trajectory of financial reforms and the regulatory framework in Part I, followed by a detailed analysis of crucial financial indicators in Part II. Chapter 2 delves into the unique factors shaping China's banking industry, examining the reasons and drivers behind its distinct context. It evaluates the degree of alignment between China's financial regulatory framework and the Basel III standards. This initiative lays a groundwork for the subsequent chapters which focus on empirical analyses. Part I uncovers the diversified ownership structure in China's banking sector, as a direct consequence of China's financial reform and legislative progressions, alongside transformation initiatives. Contemporary corporate governance frameworks were established in commercial banks at the second stage of the reform. Heightened market competition, increased market efficiency, encouraged market access and improved the resilience of China's financial markets. The full adoption and integration of the Basel III framework into China's banking regulatory framework is evident by China's regulatory authorities issuing localized Basel III regulations. Employing the CAMELS rating system[^chapter00-intro-01], Part II examines the leading financial indicators aiming at evaluating the safety and soundness of Chinese banks. China's commercial banks have an average regulatory capital ratio exceeding 10%, higher than the Basel III standards, and maintain a lower average Non-Performing loans(NPLs) ratio compared to G20 peers. Notably, Chinese commercial banks enjoy a competitive advantage with lower cost-to-income ratios and an average return on equity exceeding 14%. While credit risk and liquidity risk are generally well-managed, especially in the largest banks, medium-sized banks, especially those historically tied to local government shareholders, may face elevated credit risk and liquidity risks due to the higher average NPL ratio and wholesale funding dependence. 

[^chapter00-intro-01]: The CAMELS rating system evaluates a bank's strength across six key categories: capital adequacy, assets, management capability, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity.

### Chapter 3. Ownership dynamics, risk and regulation in Chinese banking: New evidence

The first empirical chapter appraises the impact of Basel III capital regulation on Chinese banks' credit risk-taking, taking into account the interaction between Basel III capital ratio and ownership structure. This study employs data on 231 Chinese banks over the period 2010-2019. We also refined the data by manually collecting missing data from the individual banks' financial reports. Our results show that higher regulatory capital decreases credit risk, supporting the regulatory expectations that regulatory capital serves as a protective buffer against economic shocks and mitigates banks' proclivity for risk, aligned with the theory proposed by @MEHRAN2011. In this chapter, we provide evidence that the impact of Basel III capital regulation on credit risk-taking is influenced by ownership structure, which echoes the empirical conclusion drawn by @LAEVEN2009. Moreover, this chapter emphasizes how ownership structure affects credit risk, revealing that state-owned banks generally exhibit higher credit risk compared to foreign-owned banks and other ownership types. This aligns with the findings of @ZHU2016 and is consistent with @LAEVEN2009, indicating that banks with significant cash flow rights held by large owners are prone to higher credit risk. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of considering ownership structure in assessing the impact of regulatory measures on bank risk-taking behavior. They also highlight the need for further exploration and analysis, which the subsequent chapter (Chapter 3) is poised to provide by delving into the underlying reasons and implications of these observed patterns.



### Chapter 4. Does stringent capital regulation affect persistent or transient Chinese bank efficiency-A four-component model analysis

The second empirical study, Chapter 4, conducts an investigation regarding the impact of Basel III capital regulation on cost efficiency in the unique context of China's banking industry, using an advanced four-component Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA) model. We ask the question: Do higher capital adequacy requirements affect Chinese banks' persistent or transient cost efficiency? With an unbalanced panel data of 233 China's commercial banks over the period 2010-2020, we employ the most recent four-component SFA cost model developed by @COLOMBI2011, @COLOMBI2014, @FILIPPINI2016, and @BADUNENKO2017 to explore and explain Chinese banks' performance. This sophisticated methodology empowers our study to break down overall efficiency into two components: transient (subject to time variations) and persistent (time-invariant). Our results imply that overall inefficiency is almost evenly distributed between the two components. Notably, state-owned banks occupy a mid-tier position in the overall efficiency rankings compared to other ownership types, showcasing higher transient efficiency but markedly lower persistent efficiency. This aligns with the conclusions drawn by @FUNGACOVA2020. In exploring the impact of regulatory capital requirements on bank cost efficiency, our investigation reveals no statistically significant relation between the regulatory capital requirements and bank persistent(time-invariant) cost efficiency but a negative association between Basel III regulatory capital and transient(time-varying) efficiency. Regarding the association between ownership structure and bank cost efficiency, the results suggest that state ownership is statistically significant. Our investigation sheds light on the complex interplay between regulatory capital requirements, ownership structure, and cost efficiency within China's banking sector, offering valuable insights for policymakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders.


### Chapter 5. Assessing Systemic Risk Dynamics in Chinese Banking: The Impact of Basel III and Ownership Structures

The final empirical chapter, Chapter 5, plays a pivotal role in the comprehensive narrative, merging the micro-prudential insights from the initial two studies into the macro-prudential framework. Aligned with the regulatory priorities post-crisis, which address systemic financial stability, this chapter investigates how Basel III risk-based capital regulation influences the individual contributions of banks to systemic risk. This study utilizes the conditional value at risk (CoVaR) methodology proposed by @ADRIAN2016. Our dataset comprises 376 Chinese financial institutions, encompassing 236 Chinese commercial banks, spanning the period from 2010 to 2022. In alignment with previous research [see @LAEVEN2016_SYSTEMIC; @DEMIRGUC-KUNT2018], our results affirm that higher regulatory capital exerts a negative influence on the individual banks' systemic risk contributions. Notably, we observe an increase in systemic risk with a larger bank size. Furthermore, our study reveals that state-ownership structures exhibit a higher contribution to systemic risk compared to joint-stock and local government-holding structures, corroborating existing evidence. Our results underscore the importance of regulatory capital requirements in mitigating systemic risk and promoting financial stability within China's banking industry. They also emphasize the need for policymakers and regulators to consider the systemic implications of bank size and ownership structures when formulating regulatory frameworks aimed at safeguarding the stability of the financial system.
